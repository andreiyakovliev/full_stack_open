## Task 0.4: New Note Diagram

In this task, we focused on creating a simple diagram of a "New Note" feature, which is part of building a web application. The main goal was to visualize the process of adding a new note in the application. This task helped to understand the fundamental concepts of how web applications work, especially regarding user interaction and the flow of data.

The diagram includes the following steps:
1. **User clicks on the 'Create New Note' button**: The user initiates the creation of a new note by clicking the button.
2. **Input fields appear**: A form with input fields for the note's title and content appears on the screen.
3. **User enters data**: The user fills out the form with the note's details.
4. **Save note**: Once the user is done, the note is saved, and the note data is added to the application's storage.

This diagram is part of understanding the structure and flow of a web application, which is crucial in the early stages of development. The task helped reinforce key concepts like user interface elements, input handling, and data storage.
